## 📌 Project Overview  
This repository contains the **Sistemas Operativos 2025** group project at UPC.  
The project follows a structured workflow using **Git and GitHub** to ensure smooth collaboration, version control, and clear documentation of each development phase.  

## 📂 Repository Organization  
This repository is structured into different branches and files to keep track of each development version:  

### **🔖 Main Branches**  
- `main` → The stable version of the project, containing only verified and completed releases.  
- `vN-dev` → The development branch for each version (`v1-dev`, `v2-dev`, etc.).  

### **📁 Repository Files**  
- `README.md` → Project documentation and versioning details.  
- `/client/` → Code of the client.
- `/server/` → Code of the server.
- `/docs/` → Additional documentation, diagrams, and development notes.

## **🔄 Development Workflow**  
Each version follows a **three-step process**, with roles rotating for each version.  

### **🛠 Step 1: Generator (Development Phase)**  
The **Generator** is responsible for developing the new version of the project.  
1. Pull the latest changes:  
   ```bash
   git pull
   ```
2. Create a new branch for the version:  
   ```bash
   git checkout -b vN-dev
   ```
3. Implement changes and commit progress:  
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Version N generated by [Your Name]"
   ```
4. Push the branch to GitHub:  
   ```bash
   git push -u origin vN-dev
   ```
5. Verify that the branch is visible on GitHub.

### **🔍 Step 2: Verifier (Testing & Validation)**  
The **Verifier** ensures the new version works correctly before merging it into `main`.  
1. Pull the latest changes and switch to the version branch:  
   ```bash
   git pull
   git checkout vN-dev
   ```
2. Test the game, fix errors, and validate the implementation.  
3. Update `README.md` with:  
   ```plaintext
   Version N verified by [Verifier’s Name]
   ```
4. Merge `vN-dev` into `main`:  
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git merge vN-dev
   git push origin main
   ```
5. Delete the development branch once confirmed:  
   ```bash
   git branch -d vN-dev
   git push origin --delete vN-dev
   ```

### **📢 Step 3: Communicator (Demo & Documentation)**  
The **Communicator** prepares the demonstration and documents the release.  
1. Pull the latest validated version:  
   ```bash
   git pull
   ```
2. Record a **video demonstration** and host it online.  
3. Update `README.md` with:  
   ```plaintext
   Version N communicated by [Communicator’s Name]
   Video URL: [Demo Link]
   ```
4. Create a **GitHub Release** with tag `vN` for easy access:  
   ```bash
   git tag vN
   git push origin vN
   ```
